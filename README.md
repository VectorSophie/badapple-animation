Lets imagine, youre a touhu fan(even though im not)
But you dont know how to use Photoshop or AfterEffect, thats for nerds!
So i made a python code for just that.

Requirements.
1. you have the badapple.flv file that i added in the repository
2. you have two folders that will contain the binary frame and frames(which the code will make for you if you didnt)
3. you downloaded ffmpeg(you need the .exe file which is probably in the bin folder)
4. you installed PIL, subprocess, os, cv2, numpy(just type pip install [model name] into cmd)

If you did all of them, great! Just adjust the file paths, the animation speed, and maybe even the video itself.
Enjoy.
